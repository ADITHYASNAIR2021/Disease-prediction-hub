        "Stroke is a disease that affects the arteries leading to and within the brain. A stroke occurs when a blood vessel that carries oxygen and nutrients to the brain is either blocked by a clot or ruptures. According to the WHO, stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death worldwide.\n",
        "\n",
        "Globally, 3% of the population are affected by subarachnoid hemorrhage, 10% with intracerebral hemorrhage, and the majority of 87% with ischemic stroke. 80% of the time these strokes can be prevented, so putting in place proper education on the signs of stroke is very important. The existing research is limited in predicting risk factors pertained to various types of strokes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Early detection of stroke is a crucial step for efficient treatment and ML can be of great value in this process. To be able to do that, Machine Learning (ML) is an ultimate technology which can help health professionals make clinical decisions and predictions. During the past few decades, several studies were conducted on the improvement of stroke diagnosis using ML in terms of accuracy and speed.\n",
